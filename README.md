# PyCitySchools Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze school district data provided using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks.

In the project I utilized dataframes to analyze school district data to calculate school sizes, school spending, and passing rates too see how size and spending affect passing rates.

# Summary

In this project i'll be 'helping' the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, i've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I've been given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I created a report that includes the following data:

    1. District Summary:

        Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame. Include the following:

            - Total number of unique schools

            - Total students

            - Total budget

            - Average math score

            - Average reading score

            - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

            - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

            - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

    2. School Summary

        Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school. Include the following:

            - School name

            - School type

            - Total students

            - Total school budget

            - Per student budget

            - Average math score

            - Average reading score

            - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

            - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

            - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

    3. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

        Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

    4. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

        Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

    5. Math Scores by Grade

        Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

    6. Reading Scores by Grade

        Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
