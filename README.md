# PyCitySchools_Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze school district data provided using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.

PyCitySchools: PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb Resources: schools_complete.csv/students_complete.csv

In the project I utilized dataframes to analyze school district data to calculate school sizes, school spending, and passing rates too see how size and spending affect passing rates.
